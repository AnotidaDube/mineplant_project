2. Overlay Cost or Revenue Data
This means adding a second line or bar to the graph that shows:

Cost per ton mined

Revenue per gram of ore

Profit margin per day or phase

📈 Example:
Imagine your graph shows high tonnage but low grade — overlaying cost data might reveal that day was expensive but inefficient. Or vice versa: high grade + low cost = maximum profitability.

🔍 Why it matters:
Helps decision-makers optimize operations for value, not just volume

Supports budgeting, forecasting, and investment planning

🤖 3. Build a Predictive Model for Grade-Tonnage Trends
This means using machine learning to forecast:

Future ore grades based on geological patterns

Expected tonnage from upcoming mine phases

Risk zones or low-yield areas before they’re mined

🧠 How it works:
You feed historical data (like the graph you shared) into a model that learns patterns. It can then predict what tomorrow’s grade and tonnage might be — even before drilling starts.

🔍 Why it matters:
Enables proactive planning instead of reactive decisions

Reduces waste and improves resource targeting

Can be integrated into your dashboard for real-time forecasting

If you want, I can help you:

Add tooltips using Plotly or Chart.js

Integrate cost/revenue overlays from your expense logs

Start building a simple predictive model using scikit-learn or TensorFlow

You’ve already built the foundation — now we can turn it into a decision-making engine. Let’s pick one and dive in.
